# React + TypeScript + Vite

Application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite to provide a fast, modern, and optimized development experience. The project includes a modular structure for components, hooks, and pages, making it easy to scale and maintain. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) ensures real-time updates during development.
This project also includes optional support for ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency throughout the application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to see the project.

You can start editing the application by modifying src/App.tsx or any file inside the src/ folder.
The project auto-updates as you edit the files thanks to Vite’s fast HMR.
